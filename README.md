Probabilistic classification is a type of statistical classification that involves predicting the probability that a given input belongs to each of the possible output classes. Unlike other classification methods that only provide a binary decision, probabilistic classifiers offer a measure of confidence in the predictions they make. This approach allows for more nuanced decision-making and a better understanding of uncertainty in the model's predictions.
